Tickets were also open for a long time and users had to email the group for an update. I interviewed staff and mapped the business process. I led the development and design of a business application that would replace the email process with a secure ticketing system.</p>
                          </p>I streamlined the business process around tickets and system documentation.
                               Tickets became searchable by staff, and role based access control allowed the ability to also create a knowledgebase within the system. Searchable content replaced documents stored in various formats in a shared drive.

The goal was to find pain points and opportunities for users on their journey to complete case reviews. The new process used user-centered design principles.

                            <p>A security first mindset approach was necessary in order to comply with various security and compliance requirements. Drupal, an open source solution, was used to build a secure web application. Organization of the reviews and records retention became an automated process. They were able to reduce their time to review cases. The outcomes of their reviews generate real time reports. The unit is able to analyze their historical data and make improvements.</p>

                            <p>Currently I am responsible for data management and reporting. Iâ€™ve researched multiple databases in order to get an understanding of the Countyâ€™s data engineering. In doing so, Iâ€™ve discovered report extracts that I then use to create advanced reports using Python programming. Iâ€™ve advised staff on how to implement best practices on reporting, and how to increase performance on internal dashboards. I serve as a technical and business knowledge resource. Data sources include csv extracts, Oracle Business Intelligence, and ad hoc reports from Crystal Reports. I also train staff on Excel and Power Query in order to automate their reporting needs using Teams due to the remote workplace. I also use Power Query to automate the ETL process for Excel dashboards.
                            I've developed a Python program to process PDF case reviews into CSV files for staff.</p>

                              I created the account management policy for 250+ users across multiple HHS departments. I focused on creating role based access controls to streamline and improve application security. I led five team members and transformed unit into a service desk. I trained them on security, content management, troubleshooting, change management, requirements, design, and technical writing. I streamlined our help desk procedures by developing a custom ticketing information system to modernize the business processes. I saved the County $200,000 in the costs of implementing a HIPAA/PII compliant system by using open source technology. I pionereed knowledge base to share resources with all staff on latest updates and changes. I also developed landing page for the marketing of a new information system set to release in Sept 2021. Tracked change management and releases and created easy to read documentation using plain language on the latest system updates. I advised supervisors on system customization and workflows for their unit by using automation as a solution for their lack of staff.

                            Used Python for analysis on a Code for America project that joined a report of e-applications they submitted through CIV and I matched the cases with applications received. This was used to inform clients when their SAR 7 reports were due. Marin was the first CIV county to use the get calfresh website for SAR report submission.</p>
